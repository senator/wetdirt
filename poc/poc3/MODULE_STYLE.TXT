Mainly I'm concerned with what modules should export.

When modules export static methods or module variables
(module-as-singleton), those methods or variables should be named in
littleCamelCase.

When modules export constructors, those constructors should be named in
BigCamelCase, but they should not *be* the entire module export (e.g.,
module.exports = FooThing)

When modules export constants, those constants should be named in
ALL_CAPS_SNAKE_CASE.

Modules themselves should be named in littleCamelCase both on the
filesystem and when given a variable reference.
